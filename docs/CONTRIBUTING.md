## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v47-tier1-team-04/wiki/Work-Flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `alpha`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL 3.0 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL License](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v47-tier1-team-04/blob/alpha/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v47-tier1-team-04/issuess); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

This repository has a handy [bug report template](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v47-tier1-team-04/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report-template.md&title=) you can use to make bug reporting simple and consise.
